## Prompt for creating this app for chatgpt-4o
You‚Äôre a veteran full-stack developer. Please generate a complete, ready-to-push GitHub repository called ‚Äúmarkdown-previewer‚Äù that implements a static single-page web app suitable for GitHub Pages. The app must let users type or paste Markdown into a left-side textarea and immediately see the rendered HTML in a right-side pane. In your output, include:

The exact shell commands to create the project folder, initialize Git, create the docs, css, js, and .github/workflows directories.

A listing of the entire project structure showing README.md, docs/index.html, docs/css/style.css, docs/js/app.js, and .github/workflows/pages.yml.

A fully written README.md with a brief description of the app and clear instructions for cloning the repo, pushing to the main branch, and enabling GitHub Pages from the docs folder.

The complete contents of docs/index.html, including standard HTML5 boilerplate, a heading, a container with a textarea and a preview div, links to style.css, the marked.js CDN script, and the app.js script.

The complete contents of docs/css/style.css defining a full-height, split-screen layout with basic styling for the heading, editor, and preview.

The complete contents of docs/js/app.js registering an input listener on the textarea that uses marked.js to convert Markdown to HTML and updates the preview pane, initializing once on page load.

The complete contents of .github/workflows/pages.yml configuring a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on pushes to main, checks out the repo, and deploys the docs folder to GitHub Pages using the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages action.

Do not include any extraneous explanation or commentary‚Äîjust the precise commands, structure outline, and file contents.
